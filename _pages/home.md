​​​​​​​**Welcome to the webpage of the University of Miami's Geodynamics Group, located within the [Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences](https://www.graduate.rsmas.miami.edu) and led by [Adam Holt](https://adamfholt.github.io/team/).**
<br>
<br>
We strive to isolate the forces that govern the geologic evolution of plates, plate boundaries and the flowing mantle, and, in turn, constrain the rates and scales over which deformation occurs. To achieve this, we integrate a variety of modeling techniques with geological observations. See the Research page for more info.
<br>
<br>
**Ph.D. studentships are available for Fall 2021. See [here](https://graduate.rsmas.miami.edu/_assets/pdf/phd-assistanships/advert-fall2021.pdf) and [here](https://www.graduate.rsmas.miami.edu/admissions/phd-assistanships/index.html) for more details and get in touch via email (aholt@miami.edu) if you are interested!**
