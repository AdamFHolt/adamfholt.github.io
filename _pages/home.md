​​​​​​​I am a Geodynamicist at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science.

**I am building a Geodynamics research group at UM and have a Ph.D. studentship for Spring 2021. If you are interested, please get in touch!**
​
In my research, I strive to isolate the forces that govern the geologic evolution of plates and plate boundaries and, in turn, constrain the rates and scales over which deformation occurs. To achieve this, I integrate a diverse set of modeling techniques with a range of geological observations (see links below and Research page for more details).
