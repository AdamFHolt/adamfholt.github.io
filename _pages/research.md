# Research overview

## Regional subduction dynamics 
 â€‹
We utilize a variety of modeling approaches to develop an understanding of how subduction zones operate, in general and within a range of tectonic regions. 
<br>
<br>
## Global geodynamics

We develop methods to place regional subduction dynamics into a global mantle convection framework. What are the nature of the two-way interactions between these two scales?
<br>
<br>
## Plate kinematics and plate reconstructions

We use plate kinematic observations and reconstructions to test simple mechanical models for tectonic observables (e.g. trench and plate motions)
