​​​​​​​**Welcome to the webpage of Adam F Holt and the University of Miami's (UM) Geodynamics Group.**
<br>
<br>
We strive to isolate the forces that govern the geologic evolution of plates, plate boundaries and the flowing mantle, and, in turn, constrain the rates and scales over which deformation occurs. To achieve this, we integrate a diverse set of modeling techniques with a range of geological observations.
