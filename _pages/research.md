# Research

 
1)  Regional subduction dynamics​
​
We utilize numerical and analytical modeling approaches to develop an understanding of how subduction zones operate, in general and within a range of tectonic regions. 

A numerical subduction model constructed using the ASPECT mantle convection code.

2) Global geodynamics

We develop methods to place subduction dynamics into a global mantle convection framework.

Numerical computation of the global pressure field induced by time-dependent subduction of a single plate

3) Plate kinematics and plate reconstructions

We use plate kinematic observations and reconstructions to test simple mechanical models.
