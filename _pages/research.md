# Research overview
After a (very) brief overview of our research, check out the images below for examples of some of our active projects.
<br>

## 1 - Regional subduction dynamics 
 â€‹
We utilize a variety of modeling approaches to develop an understanding of how subduction zones operate, in general and within a range of tectonic regions. Regions of focus include the complex sudbuction configurations in the Western Pacific and the Caribbean.
<br>
## 2 - Global geodynamics

We develop methods to place regional subduction dynamics into a global mantle convection framework. Ultimately, we aim to assess the nature and strength of the two-way interactions between the regional and global scales.
<br>
## 3 - Plate kinematics and plate reconstructions

We use plate kinematic observations and reconstructions to test simple mechanical models for tectonic observables like trench motions.
